Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of three fundamental tree data structures in Python:
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Red-Black Tree (RBT)
AVL Tree

Each tree structure supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching, along with traversal methods.

Features

Binary Search Tree (BST)
Insertion: Adds a new node while maintaining the BST property.
Deletion: Removes a node and restructures the tree accordingly.
Searching: Checks for the existence of a value in the tree.
Traversal: Supports in-order traversal to display the tree's contents.

Red-Black Tree (RBT)
Insertion: Adds a new node and ensures that the red-black properties are maintained.
Deletion: Removes a node while preserving the red-black properties.
Searching: Checks for the existence of a value in the tree.
Traversal: Supports in-order traversal to display the tree's contents.

AVL Tree
Insertion: Adds a new node and balances the tree if necessary.
Deletion: Removes a node and ensures that the AVL balance property is maintained.
Searching: Checks for the existence of a value in the tree.
Traversal: Supports in-order traversal to display the tree's contents.

Usage
Installation: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Running Tests: The main script includes test cases for each tree type. You can run it to see how each implementation works and verify their functionality.

Testing
The implementation includes test cases that demonstrate:
Insertion of multiple keys into each tree type.
Deletion of specific keys and how the trees restructure themselves.
Searching for existing and non-existing keys.
In-order traversal outputs to verify correct ordering of elements.

Conclusion
This repository provides a solid foundation for understanding and implementing essential tree data structures in Python. Each implementation is designed to illustrate key concepts and operations associated with BSTs, Red-Black Trees, and AVL Trees.
